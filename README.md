# French Military Hospitals 1630-1815

## Project Description
This repository has two goals. The first is to gather in a single location a significant number of documents relating to early modern French military hospitals. The second is to facilitate the application of quantitative methodologies to those documents.

## Rough Data Map

### Hosptial Statistics 
In this folder are CSV files produced from archival documents held at the French war archives at Vincennes. More detailed information for these found on the Readme.md file in the folder itself, but information found here includes number of patients, number of patients healed, number of patients deceased etc... This data set is incomplete and will be updated periodically. 

### Journals 
The military supported two medical jounrals in the 18th century. The first was edited by Hauterierck, entitled *Recueil d'observations de médecine des hôpitaux militaires* and ran between 1766 and 1767. The second was edited by Dehorne, entitled *Journal de médecine militaire* and was published between 1781 and 1788. Only a few volumes have been uploaded so far, with more coming soon, 

## Work Log 
**February 2 (total time: 6 hours)**
* Converted JPEGs files of archival documents to PDF files 
* Ran PDF files through Fine Reader OCR to produce quality tables 
* Saved OCR'd files as word documents 
* Copied and pasted resulting tables into Excel 
* Cleaned by hand (OCR was pretty good, but still very time consumming) 
* Saved as CSV files
* Uploaded CSV files to github 
* Worked on learning Markdowns for repository
